# How-well-you-know-your-favorite-movie-
This is a single web page that quizzes the user on their favorite movie to see how well they know it. 

# Movie/Series Quiz

## Overview
This project is a simple web-based application that introduces users to a movie quiz experience.  
The purpose of the app is to demonstrate how a web interface can guide users through stages: entering their name, selecting a movie, and later extending into quiz questions.  
It is built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, making it lightweight and easy to extend.

## Functionality
- **Stage Navigation**:  
  The app moves the user through stages:
  1. Entering their name
  2. Selecting a movie (currently "Inception")

- **Responsive Design**:  
  A clean UI with panels and cards styled in CSS, designed to be visually simple and responsive.

- **Minimal JavaScript Logic**:  
  Vanilla JavaScript handles the transitions between stages with minimal code for readability.

- **Extensibility**:  
  Designed to be easily extended with:
  - More movie options
  - Movie-specific quiz questions
  - A scoring system and results view

## Choices and Challenges
- **Choices**:  
  - Used **plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript** instead of a framework to keep the project simple and beginner-friendly.  
  - Adopted a **stage-based layout** (`step-name`, `step-pick`) for clarity and easy extension.  
  - Included one movie option ("Inception") to keep the first version lightweight while leaving room for more.

- **Challenges**:  
  - Managing navigation between quiz stages without overcomplicating the JavaScript.  
  - Designing the CSS to look modern but still remain simple and easy to maintain.  
  - Ensuring accessibility by using semantic HTML elements (labels, headings, and ARIA roles).
