# How-well-you-know-your-favorite-movie-
This is a single web page that quizzes the user on their favorite movie to see how well they know it. 

# Movie/Series Quiz

A simple web-based quiz app where users can enter their name and pick a movie to start the game.  
Currently, the app has **two stages**:
1. Enter your name  
2. Pick a movie (Inception is available as the first option)

This project is a starting point and can easily be extended with more movies and quiz questions.
